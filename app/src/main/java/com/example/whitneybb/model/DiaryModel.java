    * Keys To Successfully Writing a Diary
A diary is a personal journey and should not be compared to any other writings, but here are a few way you can get the most out of your experience.

Be honest
Your diary is for your eyes only, so be honest with yourself. Don’t hide anything or hold back.

Be frequent
The more often you write, the better.

Be natural
Don’t try to write a certain way, just be yourself.*/
